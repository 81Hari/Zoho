<h1>Sort Based On The Weight</h1>

Given a set of numbers like <10, 36, 54, 89, 12> we want to find sum of weights based on the following conditions<br><br>
    1. 5 if a perfect square<br>
    2. 4 if multiple of 4 and divisible by 6<br>
    3. 3 if even number<br>
    4. 2 Otherwise<br><br>
And sort the numbers based on the weight and print it as follows <br><br>
<10, its weight>,<36, its weight><89, its weight>

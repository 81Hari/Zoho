<h1>Average of Subset is Equal to Average of the Actual Array</h1>

Given an array of numbers find a subset from the array such that the
average for the whole set of numbers should equal the average of the
numbers in the subsets deduced from the main array.

<b>E.g.: </b>

<b>Input =</b> [10, 20, 30, 40] <br>
<b>Output =</b> [20, 30],[10, 40]<br>

<b>Input =</b> [20, 40, 60] <br>
<b>Output =</b> [40],[20, 60]<br>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finding all the subsets of array using backtracking </li>
<li> And checking all the subsets average with arrays average<li>
<ul>
